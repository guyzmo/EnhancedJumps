DESCRIPTION
This plugin enhances the built-in CTRL-I / CTRL-O jump commands: 
- After a jump, the line, column and text of the next jump target are printed: 
    next: 3,9 ENHANCED JUMPS    by Ingo Karkat
- An error message and the valid range for jumps in that direction is printed
  if a jump outside the jump list is attempted: 
    Only 8 older jump positions.
- In case the next jump would move to another buffer, only a warning is
  printed at the first attempt:
    next: EnhancedJumps.vim
  The jump to another buffer is only done if the same jump command is repeated
  once more immediately afterwards; like this: Pressing CTRL-O, noticing the
  warning, then quickly pressing CTRL-O again to overcome the warning. 
  With this, you can eagerly jump around the current buffer. Because you will
  be warned when a jump would move to another buffer, you're much less likely
  to get lost. 

USAGE
Simply use the CTRL-O and CTRL-I commands to go to an older / newer cursor
position in the jump list. When a warning "next: {file}" is echoed, quickly
repeat the jump command to move to that buffer (a [count] need to not be
typed again; if you do include the [count], it must be the same as before). 
If you do not want to move to that buffer, just ignore the warning, and
continue browsing the current buffer. On the next jump attempt, the warning
will be repeated.
